# SoYammy App
Food and proper nutrition App.

## Project idea
This app will help you if you don't know what to cook, if you want to start eating right or go on a diet.
With it, you can plan the purchase of the right foods for dinner or breakfast and save your favorite recipes to your personal profile.

## Important
`We had less than 2 weeks to write the project from 0 and test it.`
`First, we as a whole team wrote the backend on the node, connected the mongo database, and only then started creating the frontend`
